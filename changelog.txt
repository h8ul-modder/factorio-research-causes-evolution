Version: 16.4.0
Date: 13. 12. 2018
  Changes:
    - Complete rewrite. Removed runtime setting making all tech equal as there is a replacement startup setting.
  Features:
    - Technology effects on evolution shown in tech tree.
    - Startup setting to decide whether evolution effects are weighted to early tech, late tech, or equal. Early tech
    gives evolution more similar to vanilla where evolution is faster at the beginning of the game and gradually tapers
    off.
    - Startup setting to control whether upgrade technologies effect evolution. The default has now changed to include
    upgrades, giving a smoother evolution change through the tech tree.
    - Evolution automatically recalculated when technologies or startup settings change.
    - Disabled technologies are excluded from the evolution calculations, improving compatibility with other mods.
