# Research causes evolution

Replaces vanilla enemy evolution (time/pollution/spawner kills) with a new evolution mechanic: unlocking technologies
now increases biter evolution!

In my view, this makes for a better pace through the game. It's common in vanilla for players to devote almost all
their resources to research, and rush through the technology tree and barely experience mid-game technologies before
they move on. Now, rushing technology isn't necessary to keep up with biters; in fact it is a bad idea if you haven't
built up your defenses!

**Note**: this mod was adopted by H8UL and has since been completely rewritten. Credit to admo for the original mod.

## Features

- Technology effects on evolution shown in tech tree
- Startup setting to decide whether evolution effects are weighted to early tech, late tech, or equal for all techs
- Startup setting to control whether upgrade technologies effect evolution
